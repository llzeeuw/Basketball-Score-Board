## My process
- First I set up the semantic structure of the HTML file.
- Secondly I adapted the design from the Figma file so the colors would be a bit more bold with CSS. 
- Thirdly I added the JavaScript functionality.
- Made the app responsive by changing the flex-direction for mobile devices. 

### Languages and Tools

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Figma


### What I Learnt

- I brushed up on my Flexbox skills. I learned how to correctly size and place the buttons. 
- Learned about the usefulness of the gap property. 
- Learned about when to add a div and when not. 
- I used text-shadow for increased visibility on the titles. 
- Thou shall not use the same ID twice. I accidentally used the same ID twice in the HTML file. This resulted in an error with the Guest score display. The scoring buttons worked but the score board and score display shrunk in size the moment you would click the button. I first thoroughly checked if there was a Javascript error in the functions but the Javascript was all fine.
After asking some fellow developers they pointed out it might be an ID issue and I found the bug. Very useful to see how small mistakes can cause big problems. All this aided in developing my problem and bug solving skills.
